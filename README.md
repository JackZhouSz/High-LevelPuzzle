## About <a name = "about"></a>
This repo presents a computational approach to design high-level interlocking puzzles. We implemented our computational design tool in C++ and `libigl` [Jacobson et al. 2018] on a desktop computer with 3.6 GHz 8-Core Intel processor and 16 GB RAM.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
We need to install `CGAL` before running our code. With the help of `brew`, we can easily get `GGAL`.

```
brew install cgal
```

### Compile

```


```

### Running

```


```

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>
These instructions guide you how to use our code to generate high-level interlocking puzzle by yourself.

Here is the control panel of our high-level puzzle generator. There are 6 components in the control panel: `Parameter Control`, `Status Bar`, `High Level Puzzle Constructor`, `Modifying High Level Puzzle`, `Assembly State Viewer` and `Render Control`.

</p>

### Parameter Control

#### `Piece Number` 
Determine the number of pieces `K`.

#### `Level of Difficulty`
Determine the level of difficulty `L`. The program will keep running until constructing a puzzle with level of difficulty equal or higher than `L`.

#### `Seed Number`
With the same seed number, users can regenerate the same puzzle as before.

#### `Puzzle Tolerance`
This parameter is set for fabrication only, which can control the gap between pieces.

### Status Bar

#### `Puzzle State`
Indicate state (e.g. interlocking and deadlocking) of current puzzle.

#### `Level of Difficulty`
Level of difficult of current puzzle.

### High Level Puzzle Constructor

#### `Read`
Our program can read 2 types of input files: `.puz` and `.vol` file. 

#### `Construct`
Construct the `K` piece level-`L` puzzle with given import volume.

#### `Save Puz`
Save puzzle generated by our program.

#### `Reset`
Reset all the parameters.

### Modifying High Level Puzzle
From our observation, `High Level Puzzle Constructor` can easily find a puzzle if the target level is less than 10. If you want to generate a higher level puzzle, you can modify current puzzle to reach higher level puzzle.

#### `Modifying Target Level`
The target level after modifying current puzzle.

#### `Modifying`
Start modifying currrent puzzle. 

#### `Save Puz - Modifying`
Save puzzle after modifying. By default, if our program cannot find a higher level modification in 10 mins, our code will stop.

### Assembly State Viewer

#### `Disassembly Step`
Determine the disassembly step.

#### `Prev`
Previous disassembly step.

#### `Next`
Next disassembly step.

### Render Control
Control the object visualization state.
